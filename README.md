# currencyCalculator
Java desktop application which counts currencies between GBP and PLN. It's based on NBP api-fetch currency courses.

## Prerequisites
To run the solution you need to have a compiler and  a JDK. I personally used Apache NetBeans 12 and a JDK 13. 

## Running
You need to download the folder with the solution and open the project from your disk in your compiler and then run it using such or build it. Another option is to run the jar file which is already bundled in the repositiory with the command line using:
`java -jar  CurrencyCalculator\dist\CurrencyCalculator.jar`
